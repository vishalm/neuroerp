"""
AI-Native ERP System - API Routes

This module defines the REST API routes for the AI-Native ERP system.
It includes endpoints for interacting with different AI agents, the neural data fabric,
and the autonomous process orchestration.

The routes are organized by domain:
- System-wide routes: /status, /insights, /token
- Finance agent routes: /finance/*
- HR agent routes: /hr/*
- Supply chain agent routes: /supply-chain/*
- Operations agent routes: /operations/*
- Neural data fabric routes: /neural-fabric/*
- Workflow orchestration routes: /orchestrator/*

Each endpoint is designed to work with AI-native components, providing
intelligent responses, vector-based search, and autonomous workflows.
